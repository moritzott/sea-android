# Sea for Android
Andoid Version for Sea.

## Installation
Currently the Sea-App is not available in the Google Play Store (maybe in future). But you can download a signed APK-File for Android in my Google Drive Folder and install it manually on your phone. You may need to go to your system settings and allow to install Apps from other sources.

So here are the steps:
1. [Download the signed APK-File from Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1o7TjiX0CLmcY9_hzpqRd4NWtohqX_aBw/view?usp=sharing).
2. Go to your Android system settings and allow installing apps from other sources. 
3. Go to your Download-Folder and click on the downloaded APK-File to install it on your phone. 
4. That's it! 

## Minimum Requirements
* API 16: Android 4.1 (Jelly Beans) 

## Current Version
* Sea v1.0-alpha
